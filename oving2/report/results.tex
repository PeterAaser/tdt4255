\chapter{Results}

By expanding the microarchitecture from Exercise 1 \cite{compendium} with a forwarder, pipeline registers, hazard detection and improved ALU, PC and control modules, we succeeded in implementing a pipelined, multi-cycle, MIPS-like processor.
Each component was tested with individual testbenches.
The processor (MIPSProcessor-module) was tested with a testbench including instruction and data memory.
In this way, reading of instructions and writing of data can be simulated and verified.
We also uploaded the bitfile to an FPGA in the lab and verified correctness using the \texttt{hostcomm} utility.
