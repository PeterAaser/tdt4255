\chapter{Results}

By expanding the microarchitecture from Exercise 1 \cite{compendium} with a forwarder, pipeline registers, hazard detection and improved ALU, PC and control modules, we succeeded in implementing a pipelined, multi-cycle, MIPS-like processor.
Each component was tested with individual testbenches.
The processor (MIPSProcessor-module) was tested with a testbench including instruction and data memory.
This way, reading of instructions and writing of data can be simulated and verified.
We also uploaded the bitfile to an FPGA in the lab and verified correctness using the \texttt{hostcomm} utility.

\section{Testing in ISim}
Testsbenches for the all modules except the pipeline registers were written and run is ISim. 

\section{Testing on the FPGA}
When the system had been tested thoroughly in ISim, a bitfile was generated, and uploaded to an FPGA, via Hostcomm. The FPGA's instruction memory is loaded with the code in Listing \ref{lst:testcode}. Figure \ref{fig:hostcomm} shows the result of a successful execution on our design. The correctness of the implementation is ensured by comparing the data memory loaded from the FPGA, after it has run for a short time, with the comments in Listing \ref{lst:testcode} that states "Saving value ...".
