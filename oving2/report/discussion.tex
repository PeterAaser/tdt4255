\chapter{Discussion}

While we managed to complete the exercise and implement a fully functioning pipelined processor, we were surprised at the amount of work needed.
The idea of transitioning from the implementation from the previous exercise to a pipelined one by introducing pipeline registers and modifying the control path, seems simple enough.
While introducing and wiring up the major changes in the system is easy enough, pipelining introduces a lot of subtle potential bugs and hazards.
These hazards are hard to predict before actually encountering them.
They are also hard to test in single-module testbenches (e.g.: tb\_ALU, tb\_ProgramCounter, etc.), as they are often due to the interaction between the modules in different stages as well as the registers in between.

We were eager to implement support for more
