\chapter*{Abstract}

This report outlines our solution to Exercise 2 - An Optimized Pipelined Processor for the subject TDT4255 - Computer Design.
The goal of the exercise is to improve our implementation of a multi-cycle MIPS processor from Exercise 1 by introducing pipelining and related optimization techniques.
The pipelined implementation should, at minimum, support the same instructions as the implementation from exercise 1.

This report gives a slightly more thorough description of the exercise task as well as an in-depth description of the technicalities of our implementation and descriptions of the design, implementation and testing processes.

The result of our work on this exercise is a functioning implementation of the requested processor architecture, which has been verified in software simulation by testbenches and tested on an FPGA.
