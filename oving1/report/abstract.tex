\chapter*{Abstract}

This report outlines our solution to Exercise 1 - Simple Multi-cycle MIPS processor for the subject TDT4255 - Computer Design.
The goal of the exercise is to implement a simple multi-cycle processor in VHDL.
The processor should support a subset of the MIPS instruction set, a typical RISC instruction set.

This report gives a slightly more thorough description of the exercise task as well as an in-depth description of the technicalities of our implementation and descriptions of the design, implementation and testing processes.

The result of our work on this exercise is a functioning implementation of the requested processor architecture, which has been verified in software simulation by testbenches and tested on an FPGA.
