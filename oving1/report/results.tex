\chapter{Results}

By implementing a microarchitecture comprised of a program counter, register, control and ALU modules, and wiring these together to form a control-/datapath, we succeded in implementing a multi-cycle, MIPS-like processor.
Each component was tested with individual testbenches.
The system as a whole was tested using an end-to-end testbench, as well as by uploading the bitfile to an FPGA in the lab and verifying correctness using the \texttt{hostcomm} utility.
We succeded in implementing support for the instructions listed as requirements in the exercise description.

Our implementation has two stages, Instruction Fetch and Instruction Execute.
The fetch stage is done in one clock period, while the execute stage is done in either one or two periods, depending on the instruction.
